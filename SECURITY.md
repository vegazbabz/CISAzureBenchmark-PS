This is a **community-maintained tool** provided **as-is, with no warranty of any kind**.

The maintainers and contributors:

- Offer **no SLA** and make no commitment to respond to, fix, or disclose any reported issue within any timeframe.
- Accept **no legal responsibility or liability** for the use of this tool, its output, or any decisions made based on its results.

Use of this tool is entirely at your own risk. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) for the full MIT disclaimer.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities in the tool itself.**

If you discover a potential security issue in the tool's code (e.g. credential exfiltration, code execution), you may report it using GitHub's
[private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/vegazbabz/CISAzureBenchmark-PS/security/advisories/new).

Reports are reviewed on a **best-effort, volunteer basis**. There is no guaranteed response time or commitment to fix.

### What to include

- A description of the issue and its potential impact
- Steps to reproduce or a proof-of-concept
- Any suggested mitigations

## Scope

This tool is **read-only** — it makes no changes to your Azure environment.

In-scope for vulnerability reports:

- Code that could exfiltrate credentials or execute arbitrary commands
- Logic errors causing materially incorrect audit results (e.g. a critical FAIL always reported as PASS)

Out of scope:

- Issues in the Azure CLI, PowerShell runtime, or GitHub Actions infrastructure
- Audit results that differ from your environment (report these as regular bugs)
- Feature requests or benchmark interpretation disagreements
